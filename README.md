## 1 - How to setup Git
*Nice readme file cheatsheet:* <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>

The discipline decided to use GitHub as the main repository to manage lab's deliveries. Therefore, below you will find the basic git code to proceed with activities.

### 1.1 - How to start?

First, you need to create a git repository (this can be done either via github website or via command line with the following code:

```
git init
```

If you already have a git repository, you can clone it locally using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Andre-WPP/MC202.git
```

Now, we have an active repository to work with.
