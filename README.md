## 1 - How to setup Git
*Nice readme file cheatsheet:* <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>

The discipline decided to use GitHub as the main repository to manage lab's deliveries. Therefore, below you will find the basic git code to proceed with activities.

### 1.1 - How to start?

First, you need to create a git repository (this can be done either via github website or via command line with the following code:

```
git init
```

If you already have a git repository, you can clone it locally using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Andre-WPP/MC202.git
```

Now, we have an active repository to work with.



### 1.2 - How to work with git?

Once you are logged into a repository, you can create branches

```
git branch <name>
```
then, you can select the branch to start working in it. The default branch is called 'main':

```
git checkout <name>
``` 

once you've made some change in your code, you can commit these changes locally. First you should select the specific files you want to commit using

```
git add <name>  or git add.
```
then, you may commit them using:

```
git commit -m 'A description of what has been changed'
```

Last, but not least, you can send the local updates to github server so all team members can collaborate, using:

```
git push
``` 

### 1.3 - Special cases: multiple branches.

## 2 - How to code in Java

In java, you should create a folder structure like that:

```
project-folder
|_src
  |_package1
    |_class11.java
    |_class12.java
  |_package2
    |_class21.java
    |_class22.java
  |_main.java
|_lib

```

A class must have 4 elements:
  [**1-Attributes:** variables that defines the state of an object]
  [**2-Constructor:** special method to instatiate objects and create their first state]
  [**3-Getters/Setters:** special methods to set/reset an object's attribute or use their values in the scope of the object's instantiation]
  [**4-Methods:** whatever functionality you want to give to your class]
